## Introduction

In this document, we will dive deep into **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**. We will cover What, Why, Different Tools, Best Practice, Conclusions.

## What is DAST?
Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a security testing methodology that focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in running web applications.  DAST interacts with the application in real-time to discover security weaknesses. DAST involves the use of specialized tools to test web applications for common security issues, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and security misconfigurations.

## Why DAST?

- **Real-world Simulation** :-           DAST mimics how attackers exploit vulnerabilities during runtime.           
- **Continuous Monitoring** :-         Allows for regular security assessments as applications evolve.              
- **Identifying Runtime Vulnerabilities** :- DAST discovers vulnerabilities that may only be present during execution.
