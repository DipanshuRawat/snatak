## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive guide on SonarQube Disaster Recovery (DR), outlining the necessary steps to ensure business continuity, minimize downtime, and prevent data loss. By implementing a well-structured DR plan, organizations can safeguard their SonarQube data, maintain operational stability, and recover efficiently from unexpected failures. 

---

## What is DR

Disaster Recovery (DR) refers to the strategies and processes designed to restore SonarQube functionality following system failures, cyberattacks, hardware malfunctions, or other unexpected disruptions. A well-planned DR approach ensures minimal service disruption and data integrity preservation.

---

## Why DR

A robust DR strategy is essential to:
- Ensure business continuity by reducing downtime
- Prevent critical data loss
- Maintain regulatory compliance
- Mitigate financial and operational impacts of failures
- Improve organizational resilience against disasters

---

## Backup Strategy

1. **Identify Critical Components**
   - Database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server)
   - Configuration files (`sonar.properties`, `wrapper.conf`)
   - Plugins directory

2. **Choose Backup Methods**
   - Database-specific backup tools (e.g., `pg_dump`, `mysqldump`)
   - File system backup tools (e.g., `rsync`, `tar`)

3. **Automate Backups**
   - Schedule automatic backups using scripts or backup software

4. **Use Secure and Redundant Storage**
   - Cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
   - On-premises storage with RAID configurations
   - Offsite storage for redundancy

5. **Backup Schedule**
   - **Daily**: Database backups
   - **Weekly**: Configuration and plugin backups
   - **Monthly**: Full system backup

## Recovery Process

1. **Prepare the Environment**
   - Ensure SonarQube version and dependencies match the backup environment

2. **Restore the Database**
   - PostgreSQL: `pg_restore`
   - MySQL: `mysql -u user -p dbname < backup.sql`

3. **Restore Configuration Files**
   - Copy `sonar.properties` and `wrapper.conf` to the correct directory

4. **Restore Plugins**
   - Copy backed-up plugins to `extensions/plugins/`

5. **Start SonarQube**
   - Use `./bin/<OS>/sonar.sh start`

6. **Validate Recovery**
   - Check system status at `http://<server>:9000`

## Mean Time to Recovery

1. **Assess the Impact**
   - Identify the nature and extent of the failure (e.g., database corruption, server crash, network outage)

2. **Access Backups Quickly**
   - Store backups in multiple locations to ensure quick retrieval
   - Maintain a structured backup catalog for easy identification

3. **Automate Recovery**
   - Implement scripts to automate the restoration of database and configuration files
   - Use Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or Ansible for faster deployments

4. **Perform Regular DR Drills**
   - Schedule periodic recovery tests to refine processes and reduce recovery time
   - Document lessons learned and optimize the DR plan accordingly

5. **Monitor and Optimize**
   - Use monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to detect failures early
   - Continuously refine backup and recovery strategies based on test results and real-world incidents

## Best Practices

- Automate backups to reduce manual errors
- Store backups in multiple secure locations for redundancy
- Test backups periodically to verify integrity
- Maintain detailed recovery documentation
- Implement security measures to protect backups from unauthorized access

## FAQ

### **Backup FAQ**

**Q1: How frequently should I back up my SonarQube database?**  
A: It's recommended to perform **daily database backups**, **weekly configuration and plugin backups**, and a **full system backup monthly**.

**Q2: What is the best method to back up the SonarQube database?**  
A: Use database-specific tools such as `pg_dump` for PostgreSQL, `mysqldump` for MySQL, or SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for SQL Server.

**Q3: Where should I store my backups?**  
A: Store backups in multiple locations, including **cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)**, **on-premises RAID storage**, and **offsite locations for disaster recovery**.

**Q4: How do I automate the backup process?**  
A: Use scheduled cron jobs or backup software like **Bacula, Veeam, or AWS Backup** to automate database and file backups.

**Q5: How do I verify my backups?**  
A: Periodically **restore backups in a test environment** and ensure all critical data and configurations are intact.

### **Recovery FAQ**

**Q1: What should I do if my SonarQube instance crashes?**  
A: Follow the recovery steps outlined in this guide. Ensure you have a recent backup before starting the restoration process.

**Q2: How long does it take to recover SonarQube?**  
A: Recovery time depends on database size, backup retrieval speed, and system complexity. A **well-planned DR strategy** can restore functionality **within minutes to a few hours**.

**Q3: What if my backup files are corrupted?**  
A: Maintain **multiple copies of backups** in different locations. Regularly test backup integrity by performing trial restorations.

**Q4: Can I recover SonarQube without a database backup?**  
A: No, the database contains all critical data, including analysis results and configurations. Without a database backup, a full recovery is not possible.

**Q5: How can I reduce my recovery time?**  
A: Automate recovery tasks, maintain standby instances, and perform **regular DR drills** to minimize downtime.
